<b>NOTIFICATION OF INFORMATION PRACTICES</b>
This description of the Information Practices of North American Company for Life and Health Insurance and your insurance agent is being provided in accordance with the requirements of the Insurance Information and Privacy Protection Law in effect in your state of residence.

<b>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</b>
In order to properly underwrite and administer your insurance coverage, we must collect a certain amount of necessary and helpful information.  The amount and type of information collected may vary depending on the amount and type of coverage for which you apply.  In general, we will be seeking information about your age, occupation, physical condition, health history, mode of living, avocations, and other personal characteristics.  In addition, we may collect information intended to aid in the updating and improvement of your insurance program.

You are our most important source of information, but we may also collect or verify information with the appropriate health authorizations, by contacting medical professionals and institutions which have provided care to you or members of your family proposed for coverage, employers and business associates, friends and neighbors, public records and other insurance companies to which you have applied.  We may collect information by exchanges or correspondence, by phone, or by personal contact.  In some circumstances, we may disclose personal health information to affiliate third parties without your specific authorization, for the sole purpose of obtaining insurance.

In some cases, we may ask an insurance support organization to collect information and submit an investigative consumer report to us.  That organization may retain a copy of the report and may disclose its contents to others for whom it performs such services.  You may request to be interviewed in connection with the preparation of any investigative consumer report.

<b>DISCLOSURES</b>
In some circumstances, North American Company for Life and Health Insurance may make disclosures of personal information to third parties, without your specific authorization.  Following is a brief description of some of the persons or organizations to whom certain items of information might be disclosed:
Persons or organizations which perform professional, business or insurance functions for us, such as independent claim examiners, reinsurance companies, group plan administrators, or insurance support organizations formed for the purpose of preventing or detecting fraud in insurance transactions.
Consumer reporting agencies hired to prepare investigative reports, and other insurance companies to which you have applied for coverage or benefits;
Your attending physician or treating medical professional;
Persons or organizations conducting bonafide actuarial or scientific research studies, audits or evaluations;

Please be assured that the above describes some of the disclosures which may be made, not disclosures which are always or even often made.  In any event, the information disclosed without your specific authorization will be only as much as is reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose.

For example, we would ordinarily disclose only name and address to a marketing firm, and perhaps additional information relating to age, amounts of insurance and claims experience to a scientific research organization.  If evidence of a medical condition is found which you may not know about, this information may be given to your physician or treating medical professional for explanation to you.


Information may be given to a State Insurance Department in connection with its regulation of our business, and to other governmental or law enforcement authorities to protect our legal interests or in cases of suspected fraud or illegal activities.  If ordered by subpoena, search warrant, or other court order, and if otherwise required by any federal, state, or local law, information would be disclosed.

In short, the types of information disclosed will vary depending upon the needs of the recipient and the sensitivity of the data.

<b>ACCESS TO RECORDED PERSONAL INFORMATION</b>
If you wish to review the recorded information about you in our application files, please send a written request within 90 business days of the date this notice was mailed to you.  Include your complete name, address, date of birth, and all file numbers under which you applied in the request.  Within 21 business days of receipt of your request, you will be contacted and informed of the nature and substance of recorded information in our files.  You will also be given the identity of persons or organizations to whom we have disclosed this information in the preceding two years, in addition to the name and address of any consumer reporting agency which prepared a report about you. You may request copies of recorded personal information which will be provided to you free of charge.

If your file contains medical information, we may ask you to name a medical professional licensed to treat the condition to which the medical information relates, to whom such information may be sent so that it may be explained to you.

You will not be given access to information about you which relates to and is collected in connection with or in reasonable anticipation of a claim or civil or criminal proceeding.

<b>CORRECTION, AMENDMENT OR DELETION OF RECORDED PERSONAL INFORMATION</b>
A written request may be made requesting correction, amendment, or deletion of information you believe to be inaccurate.  Within 30 business days, the disputed information will be reinvestigated; and if found to be incorrect, necessary corrections, amendments or deletions will be made.  You will be notified in writing of the change, along with persons or organizations to whom we have previously disclosed the inaccurate information.

If your request for correction is denied, you will be notified of our reasons for refusal.  If unsatisfied by our refusal and reasons, you have the right to place a statement in our files explaining what you believe to be the correct, relevant or fair information and why you disagree with our decision not to correct, amend or delete the original information.  A copy of your statement will be made a part of our file and sent to persons and organizations to whom we previously disclosed or systematically disclosed information.

<b>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</b>
We hope that you will find this explanation of our information practices helpful.  We take our responsibilities, and your rights, very seriously.  If you have any further questions about these practices, please write to us at the address given.
