    <td>
      <p><b>PROCEEDS PAYABLE: </b> If the Insured dies while this Policy is in effect, the Company will pay the Policy Proceeds to the Beneficiary upon receipt at the Administrative Office of due proof of the Insured’s death acceptable to the Company and any other information the Company may reasonably require to process the payment of the Policy Proceeds.  We may require that any request for payment of the Policy Proceeds be completed on Our forms.  “Proof of death” includes, but is not limited to, a certified copy of the death certificate of the Insured, or other lawful evidence providing equivalent information.</p>
      <p>Policy Proceeds payable at the Insured’s death are equal to:</p>
      <ol class="letter-list">
        <li>The amount of the Death Benefit plus</li>
        <li>An amount equal to the Premium already paid to Us for each policy month following the policy month of the Insured’s death; less</li>
        <li>Any unpaid Premium for the policy month in which the Insured dies, if the Insured dies during the Grace Period, the Company will deduct the unpaid Premium from the Policy Proceeds.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Policy Proceeds will be paid in one lump sum, unless You or the Beneficiary requests otherwise and such request is agreed to by the Company.  The Company will pay interest from the date of the Insured’s death until the date when Policy Proceeds are paid.  Interest will be paid at the annual interest rate determined by the Company, which will be the current interest rate being paid on proceeds left on deposit with the Company.  In determining the effective annual rate or rates, the Company shall use the rate in effect on the date of death.</p>
      <p>The Company will pay additional interest at the rate of 10% annually in the event the Policy Proceeds are not paid within 31 calendar days after the occurrence of the latest of (a), (b), and (c), where:</p>
      <ol class="letter-list">
        <li>Is the date that due proof of death, completion of any required forms, and any information We may reasonably require to process payment of the Policy Proceeds, is received by Us;</li>
        <li>Is the date We receive sufficient information to determine the Company’s liability, the extent of the liability, and the appropriate payee legally entitled to the Policy Proceeds; and</li>
        <li>Is the date that any legal impediments to payment of Policy Proceeds that depend on the action of parties other than Us are resolved and sufficient evidence of the same is provided to Us.  Legal impediments to payment include, but are not limited to:</li>
        <ul class="number-list">
          <li>The establishment of guardianships and conservatorships;</li>
          <li>The appointment and qualification of trustees, executors and administrators; or</li>
          <li>The submission of information required to satisfy state and federal reporting requirements.</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>
      <p>Any such additional interest will be paid from the date that is 31 calendar days after the last event to occur through the date of payment.</p>
      <p>The Policy Proceeds will be exempt from the claims of creditors and from legal process, to the extent the law permits.</p>
