This notice is issued to meet the requirements of Illinois law.  Illinois has passed the Illinois Religious Freedom Protection and Civil Union Act, 750 ILCS 75/1, effectiv June 1, 2011.  While the Civil Union Act ensures that parties of civil union are entitled to the same legal obligations, responsibilities, protections, and benefits afforded or recognized by the laws of Illinois to spouses the federal government or another state government may not recognize the benefits granted under this notice.  You are advised to seek expert advice to determine your rights under this contract.

The Federal Defense of Marriage Act states that civil union partners are not considered married under federal law.  Therefore the favorable tax treatment provided by the federal tax law to a surviving spouse is not available to a surviving civil union partner.  Neither North American Company nor its agents provide tax advice for information regarding federal tax laws.  Please consult a tax advisor.
