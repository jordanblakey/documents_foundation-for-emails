Dear Policyowner:

Thank you for allowing North American to be your life insurance provider. Please allow me to offer you the following information.

Due to your initial premium returning, there is no coverage and your Policy is now considered null and void.

We appreciate the opportunity to serve you. We encourage you to contact a service representative with any questions or concerns. You will also find helpful information on our website, www.NorthAmericanCompany.com.

Sincerely,
<p>
