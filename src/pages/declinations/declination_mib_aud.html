Dear <span class="dynamic inline-block" reference="policy.firstName">First</span>:

Thank you for your life insurance application and for choosing North American Life and Health Insurance Company.  During the application process, we gave you a written description of MIB, Inc., a consumer reporting agency that operates an information exchange on behalf of insurers, and informed you that MIB will arrange disclosure of any information it may have in your file.  When we evaluated your application, MIB sent a brief, coded report about you as authorized by you in your application.

We are unable to process your application due to information we received from MIB, Inc.  We acknowledge the possibility, however unlikely, that it could relate to a person with a name similar to yours. For this reason, we attempted to ascertain whether this MIB record information actually pertains to you. Because we have not been successful in making this determination, we are asking you to obtain your MIB Consumer File by contacting the MIB information office at:
