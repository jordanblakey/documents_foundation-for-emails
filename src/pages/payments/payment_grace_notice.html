The last premium payment that was processed before this letter was created is indicated above.
If you have made a more recent payment, you should call us immediately to determine whether it was received and whether any further payment is required to avoid termination of coverage at the end of the current grace period.  Our website, www.bestow’life/customer XXXNorthAmericanCompany.com, is also available 24 hours a day to access additional information regarding your Policy.

If your Policy is being paid by Payroll Deduction, your planned premium may either be below
the minimum payment amount needed for your Policy or we are no longer receiving your Payroll
Deduction.  Please contact your Payroll Office immediately to increase your deduction.

Please use the enclosed envelope to immediately forward your payment or contact us directly to arrange for a means of payment including a different credit card or an additional EFT draft for the minimum additional payment above. Also, please note that payment of any regularly scheduled premiums for which you may receive premium notices
or which may be automatically paid from your credit card or bank account may no longer be sufficient to
prevent your coverage from terminating. In the event you fail to pay the minimum additional payment reflected above, and coverage under the Policy terminates, any request for reinstatement will be subject to evidence of insurability satisfactory to us.  We strongly encourage you to contact your agent or our administrative office at (877) XXX872-XXXX0757 to obtain additional information to assist you in determining a planned premium payment amount and schedule that reflects your current goals for the Policy.

Sincerely,
Customer Service Department
